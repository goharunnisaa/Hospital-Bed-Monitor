# 🏥 Smart Hospital Bed Occupancy Monitoring & Prediction System

🔗 **Live App:** 
https://goharunnisaa-hospital-bed-monitor-app-q3dehb.streamlit.app/

A machine learning based real-time hospital bed monitoring dashboard that predicts bed usage for the next 7 days to prevent emergency shortages. It provides actionable alerts for hospital administrators to improve resource planning and patient care.



## 🎯 Objective
To avoid last-minute patient rejections by proactively forecasting bed occupancy and highlighting shortage risks in advance.



## 🚀 Key Features
✔ Real-time monitoring of hospital bed usage  
✔ 7-day demand forecasting using ML (RandomForest)  
✔ Shortage warning system (Safe / Warning / Critical)  
✔ Dynamic visualization using Plotly  
✔ Fully deployed on Streamlit Cloud  
✔ Downloadable forecast report  
✔ Dark theme for medical control-room visibility

## 🔍 How It Works
1️⃣ Data of beds per hospital is tracked  
2️⃣ ML model (RandomForest) trains on historical usage  
3️⃣ Future dates are passed to model  
4️⃣ Prediction plotted with alert badges  
5️⃣ Admin downloads forecast report  



## 🧠 ML Model
- Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor
- Inputs: Day of year, Day of week
- Output: Predicted bed usage for each day
- Improved seasonal pattern detection



## 🩺 Real-World Impact
Hospitals can:
- Plan ahead 📅  
- Increase beds before shortage ⚠  
- Improve emergency response 🚑  
- Reduce patient risk & mortality ❤️

## 📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Integration with live hospital APIs  
🔹 Mobile notifications for alerts  
🔹 Department-wise bed analytics  
🔹 ICU & ventilator prediction
